In 1896, Antoine Becquerel discovers radioactivity.

In 1942, Scientists at the University of Chicago create the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction.

The United States put in the resources. Three parallel isotope separation projects were launched in the summer of 1942. The gaseous diffusion method, finally judged to be the most promising, was industrially developed at the Oak Ridge center in Tennessee, where construction of the plant began in late 1942.

In 1951, An experimental nuclear reactor in Arco, Idaho, produces enough electricity to power four light bulbs.

In 1954, The Atomic Energy Act authorizes development of nuclear energy for civilian use.

In 1957, First commercial nuclear-powered generating station is built in Shippingport, Pa.

In 1979, Mechanical failure and human error cause loss of coolant from the reactor core at the Three Mile Island power plant, near Middletown, Pa.

In 1986, Chernobyl disaster occurs in Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union. Contamination from the radioactive fallout spreads to 58,000 square miles.

In 1996, Last nuclear plant in the U.S., Watts Bar-1, in Spring City, Tenn., comes online.

In 2003, Dominion Power and Exelon file applications to build nuclear facilities in Virginia and Illinois, respectively. The facilities would be the first new reactors since 1996.
